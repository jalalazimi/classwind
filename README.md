# Classwind

Classwind is a JavaScript utility library designed to simplify the process of creating class names for HTML elements. It provides a quick and efficient way to assemble class names dynamically from various inputs like objects, arrays, and strings. Focusing on performance and ease of use, Classwind is well-suited for projects of all sizes and complexities, thanks to its small footprint and flexible nature.

**Note:** Classwind is a fork of [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) with a very similar API. The key differences are that Classwind is developed in TypeScript, and it incorporates [some changes](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx/pull/26) I proposed to clsx, which have since been merged. I aim to expand Classwind with additional features going forward, but as of now, the differences from clsx are minor, so feel free to continue using clsx if it suits your needs.

## Quick features

- ‚ö° **Blazing Speed**: Unmatched performance.
- ü™∂ **Ultra-Lightweight**: Just 331B!
- üåê **Framework Agnostic**: Fits any setup.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy Integration**: NPM, Yarn, CDN.
- üîí **TypeScript**: Built for reliability.
- ‚úÖ **Tested**: Dependably robust.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Via NPM

Quickly add Classwind to your project with npm:

```sh
npm install classwind
```

#### Via Yarn

Alternatively, you can use Yarn to add Classwind to your project:

```sh
yarn add classwind
```

## Usage

Embrace the simplicity and power of Classwind with additional examples to demonstrate its versatility.

### Object Input

```javascript
import cw from 'classwind';

const classes = cw({ 'bg-red-500': true, 'text-white': true, 'p-4': true });
// Result: 'bg-red-500 text-white p-4'
```

### Array Input

```javascript
import cw from 'classwind';

const classes = cw(['text-lg', 'font-bold', { 'text-red-500': true }]);
// Result: 'text-lg font-bold text-red-500'
```

### String Input

```javascript
import cw from 'classwind';

const classes = cw('bg-gray-200', 'p-4');
// Result: 'bg-gray-200 p-4'
```

### Combining Methods

```javascript
import cw from 'classwind';

const classes = cw('border-2', { 'hidden': false, 'text-green-500': true }, ['rounded-lg']);
// Result: 'border-2 text-green-500 rounded-lg'
```

### Conditional Classes

```javascript
import cw from 'classwind';

const isError = true;
const classes = cw('text-base', { 'text-error': isError, 'text-normal': !isError });
// Result when isError is true: 'text-base text-error'
```

## **Speed & Efficiency**

**Classwind stands alone in its speed and efficiency**, setting a new standard as the fastest class name generation library available. It's designed for rapid execution and minimal footprint, ensuring optimal performance in every project.
